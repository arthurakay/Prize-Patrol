Original application developed by Arthur Kay for use in the Chicago Sencha User Group:
  - http://www.akawebdesign.com/2011/05/18/sencha-touch-prize-patrol-app/
  - http://prize-patrol.senchafy.com/

The basic idea is to connect to our group's Meetup.com account and display upcoming events. For a given event, we can pick winners for our prize raffles.

Nothing exciting, but a good demonstration of Sencha Touch, our SDK Tools and the Meetup.com API.
