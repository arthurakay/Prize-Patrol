To automate our test suite, we need to run phantom-runner.sh as a pre-commit hook with Git.

To do this, we need to create (or append) the file /{rootdir}/.git/hooks/pre-commit with 777 permissions.

Copy the following code into the pre-commit file:

-----
    #!/bin/bash

    ### Find and execute the test suite
    cd test
    sh phantom-runner.sh

    exit $?
-----

Now whenever "git commit" is called this script is run! Any test failure prevent the commit from completing.
